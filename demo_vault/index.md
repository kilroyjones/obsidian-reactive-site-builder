# Vault to site

### Introduction

A program to convert Obsidian vaults into a static site. You can see an example of finished site with the default theme [here](https://vault2site.pages.dev/).

I built this because I wanted to take simple Obsidian vaults and convert them into static sites. By simple I mean that in its current state the program will fail to render certain things, such as resizing images, like below:
