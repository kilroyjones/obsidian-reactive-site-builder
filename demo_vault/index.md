# Vault to site

### Introduction 

I built this because I wanted to take simple Obsidian vaults and convert them into a static site. By simple I mean that in its current state the program will fail to render certain things, such as resizing images, like below: 
```
![[image.jpg|size]]
```
You can put these in as issues as you find them and when I have the time I'll work on adding them. Or, you can fork it and built it out how you want. See the [[Modifying/index]] section for more information on how to do that.

### Usage
