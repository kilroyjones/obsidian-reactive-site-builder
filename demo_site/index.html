<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I built this because I wanted to take simple Obsidian vaults and convert them into a static site. By simple I mean that in its current state the program will fail to render certain things, such as resizing images, like below:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>![[image.jpg|size]]
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can put these in as issues as you find them and when I have the time I'll work on adding them. Or, you can fork it and built it out how you want. See the <a href="/Modifying/index.html">Modifying/index</a> section for more information on how to do that.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/Example/index.html">Example/index</a> page for a examples of the style under the default theme.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>See the <a href="/Installation/index.html">Installation/index</a> procedures to get you started.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>MIT license - Feel free to do what you'd like with this, though it's always nice to hear if someone is using what you made.</p></div>
