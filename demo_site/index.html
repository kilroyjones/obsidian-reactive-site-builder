<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A program to convert Obsidian vaults into a static site. You can see an example of finished site with the default theme <a href="https://vault2site.pages.dev/">here</a>. At the moment only the basic features of Obsidian are implemented and the program will fail to render certain things correctly, such as resizing an image as shown below.</p>

<p>You can put these in as issues on <a href="https://github.com/kilroyjones/vault2site">github</a> as you find them and when I have the time I'll work on adding them. Or, you can fork it and build it out how you want.</p>
